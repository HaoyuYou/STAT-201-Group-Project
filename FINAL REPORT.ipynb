    "Music influences diverse aspects of human life and behaviour. Music streaming services, like spotify, have revolutionized the manner in which people consume music by providing a vast assortment of artists encompassing various genres and artistic origins. The question of what makes a song popular in this digital age has intrigued both music enthusiasts and researchers alike. Among the numerous factors contributing to a song's success, two key elements—danceability and energy—emerge as potential influencers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to explore the statistical relationship between a song's danceability, energy, and its popularity on Spotify. We will be focusing on a dataset called \"Top Spotify Songs 2023\" available on KAGGLE. This dataset holds information on various Spotify songs, their artists, where they rank, and various other features like the year of release, tempo, energy, and danceability. Spotify is one of the world's leading music streaming service providers, with over 345 million users, including 155 million subscribers, across 178 countries."

    "The variables being examined in our research are danceability and energy, which are both continuous measures that range from low to high values. These features include certain musical components.\n",
    "Danceability refers to the rhythmic components of a song that prompt physical movement and foster active participation from the listener. It encompasses elements like as tempo and rhythmic patterns, which determine a song's appropriateness for dancing or eliciting a physical reaction. Energy, however, comprises the strength and passion expressed in a musical performance. The track's emotional vitality, dynamics, and overall effect are reflected, which in turn influence the perceptions and engagement levels of listeners.\n",
    "Both of them are believed to have an impact on audience preferences in modern digital environment."
